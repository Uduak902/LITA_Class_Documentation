This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub.

### Project Title: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data for an E-commerce business to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), we hope to understand key metrics such as sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales patterns. Insights from this analysis will help drive data-informed decision-making to improve sales and customer engagement.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can freely be downloaded from an open source
online such as kaggle or FRED or any data repository site.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for Data cleaning, Analysis and Visualization [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)  
- SQL Server (SMSS) - Structured Query Language for querying of Data [Download Server Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and [SMSS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16&redirectedfrom=MSDN)
- Power BI for Visualization and to build an interactive dashboard
- Github for Portfolio Building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we performed the following action;

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

``` SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
