This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub.

### Project Title: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data for an E-commerce business to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), we hope to understand key metrics such as sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales patterns. Insights from this analysis will help drive data-informed decision-making to improve sales and customer engagement.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can freely be downloaded from an open source
online such as kaggle or FRED or any data repository site.
